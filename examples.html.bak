  on the red scare
  <br>
   Following McCarthy’s speech, American journalist Drew Pearson wrote a series of columns smearing the Senator in The Washington Merry-Go-Round, and criticized him for the following years. He was one of the first people to publicly do so, and he was unrelenting. Pearson, although he was also anti-Truman, wrote to his large audience of McCarthy’s ineptitude to such a large extent that garnered McCarthy’s attention. He made over 58  attacks, both written and spoken via radio, stating such things as “Senator McCarthy has succeeded where the Communists have failed -- in undermining the U.S. government.” McCarthy’s charges toward the administration were “far more damaging than the worst the communists could manufacture.” The backlash the Senator faced displeased McCarthy to an exasperated extent, and his reaction  was characteristic of his temperament. At a private restaurant in Washington, McCarthy vocally berated the muckraking journalist in front of a crowd. He warned Pearson he would tear him to shreds the following session in the Senate. Pearson explained to Time magazine what happened “[He] pinned my arms down, swung me around, and proceeded to kick me in the groin with his knee.” He adds that McCarthy told him to take back an insult he had made about his lack of income tax payments yet the scuffle did the opposite of scaring Pearson into silence. By his choice to speak to Time magazine, Pearson had reached a nationwide audience, who then became more weary and trusting of McCathy. McCarthy did not lie as he proceeded to rip into Pearson in front of the Senate and President.

a case for honoring the honor farm of urban appalachia
<br>
Located just south of downtown lies the ruins of the Atlanta Prison Farm, an experimental and sophisticated prison and farm run by agriculture experts and prisoners of the 1930s-1950s. The prison’s staff did not include any professionally trained correctional officers or the like, but rather was run by a farmer who took the title of warden, and more farmers as his superintendents. Dubbed the “Honor Farm”, this prison had no fences, bars, or armed guards, and allowed trustworthy prisoners to farm in its 800+ acre field. This land was also home to numerous Civil War battles, including The Battle of Atlanta. The farm is now overgrown and intensely graffitied, but the citizens of Atlanta have called for it to be transformed into a regional park with many amenities, like trails, an amphitheater, soccer fields, community gardens, etc, but to no avail; the City of Atlanta has refused to do anything with the land. The farm and its rich history have no reason to be forgotten. There are many landmarks close by that only serve as Civil War participation trophies, but this land is much more abundant. It symbolizes a grassroots prison mini-world that juxtaposes today’s violent Prison-Industrial Complex and commemorates the culture of Southern and Appalachian manners and livelihood. It encouraged vocational training in its fields as a new method of rehabilitating the incarcerated. 800 acres were cultivated and provided milk and crops for both the employees and prisoners. There is also at least one elephant from Zoo Atlanta buried on the land.

on the spiritualist movement
<br>
When women turned to Spiritualism, they no longer had any need for education, ordination, or organizational recognition as seen in established religions, which were all male-dominated. These women began to break the social rules by speaking in the male-dominated public sphere. Speaking in public was strange enough for them, but incorporated an entirely stranger element. The women began speaking in trances. The spirit would use the woman’s body as a vessel to speak to the human realm. This, along with the need for men to give approval being null, gave women spiritual agency. Women began giving lectures in trance states and many would travel to see them speak at colleges. Some of the publicity of women died slowly as they settled down and had children and spiritualism began to be practiced again in private circles by some. Achsa W Sprague, trance speaker from Vermont, kept a diary of the inner workings of trance speaking and women’s agency. She was ridden with a joint disease that prevented her walking, yet, displaying her agency, could ride horses and would do so alone. She attributed her healing to spirits; the more she carried out their wishes, the better they made her feel. She became a huge influence to Spiritualism as she showed that through it, even though she was invalid, her religious agency set her free.

on guerilla warfare in the algerian war <br>
“Glasses tinkled and voices rose and fell with laughter at the Milk-Bar” in a French part of Algiers, across from the opposing army’s tenth Region Headquarters. A woman, with lightened hair to appear Anglo-Saxon, approaches the bar and discreetly sets her bag underneath her. The woman leaves unnoticed, and a bright, instant explosion demolishes the entire eatery. At the same time in another eatery, the equivalent occurred. This planned timing of antagonism against French citizens were to make them feel unwelcomed, as they had been to Algeria for one hundred and thirty years. The war for independence had begun (O’Brien Browne). 



The city did not have hiding places in trees, subsequent garb to cover their tracks. The FLN put on or removed clothes and hid in conscious buildings or in broad daylight as if they were a common citizen. Women hid bombs in purses or guns for men to seize in order to hit another French civilian. At first, the French were not worried, but sent a limited number of troops who underestimated the power of the FLN.

on the vietnam war<br>
The Vietnam war was the first war to ever be broadcasted in people’s homes, allowing them to see the horrifying reality and war-making never before seen by regular citizens. It was well encapsulated by the popular chant, “Hey! Hey! LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?” (104). Johnson had to leave the American public on a good note at the end of his presidency, and that required a win in Vietnam. O’Donnell explains that “bad news always incited LBJ to further demands on Vietnam delivered with tirades of abuse,” but Johnson had to spin the narrative to suit himself. Johnson’s vice president Hubert Humphrey announced, “We are winning…What we are doing here is right. We have no choice but to persevere and see it through to success.” The administration was unwilling to relent no matter what atrocities and pain were going to occur, just so Johnson would win in the end. Agent Orange was deployed to ruin Vietnam’s environment to make it easier to spot guerilla warfare, along with carpet-bombing “one of the most densely populated areas in the world.” This kind of wicked behavior did not distress Johnson regarding the lives and experiences of those on the ground fighting. It only distressed him regarding his personal approval and determination to not lose.

on ibn khaldun, dynasties, and asabiyya
<br>
The decline of asabiyya, group feeling,  in a dynasty is inherent to Ibn Khaldun because as it grows older, the younger generations do not know the importance of its creation. They were not there to share the group feeling with the first caliph and generation, thus there is a divide. The younger generation has grown up in a time of comfort and tranquility. The older generations have become used to this lifestyle, too. Ibn Khaldun says the older generations have forgotten their “savagery” to uphold a dynasty. They have become senile. “No difference remains between them and ordinary city dwellers except for their fighting skill and emblems. Their military defence weakens, their energy is lost, and their strength is undermined.” (Ibn Khaldun, The Muqaddimah, 135). On top of this, royal authority gets used to luxury and grows needy. The peoples’ incomes cannot meet the needs of the royals’ wants. The people want luxury, too. Everyone “sink[s] deeper” into softness, peace, and a sedentary culture. Everyone forgets old virtues created and held strong by group feeling. Luxury also corrupts the character to Ibn Khaldun (135), acquiring evil customs and creating a sedentary culture. Both are signs of degradation, and the dynasty will fail because of the regressing group feeling.

review of 'lincoln on race and slavery' by henry louis gates, jr. (i apologize if mr. gates is reading this)
<br>

Gates wrote Lincoln’s “evolution of his own thinking about this tangled mess of issues concerning slavery and race” exhibited his determination to figure out what the right answer was the black equality question, and he did explore is beliefs so publicly and transparently. Lincoln’s anti-slavery shows consistently through Gates’s arguments, but is contested by his usage of anti-black slurs and anti-race mixing attitudes. He doubted that African Americans could self-govern, and were incapable of “fight[ing] white men effectively” as they were socially and intellectually inferior to white men (xxxvii). This being so, Lincoln demanded research into the logistics of African deportation in 1862 during his presidency, which he would still hold after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which would come to be known as the most revolutionary act for the equality of the races in U.S. history thus far. However, it was not all Lincoln behind the emancipation of slaves. It must not be forgotten that before the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Congress themselves passed the Militia Act in 1862, which allowed black soldiers into the war, another attempt by the state to incorporate more black Americans into the government without Lincoln. Lincoln even neither opposed nor promoted the enlistment of black Americans into the war as he doubted their capabilities. Gates would imply Lincoln was fighting with his own personal beliefs yet again to make groundbreaking legislation, but Wilentz shows the anti-slavery work was done within his Congress. Even after Lincoln’s announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation to Congress, which Gates claims was his triumph over his personal beliefs (40), Lincoln still supported the voluntary deportation of African Americans as he still believed whites and blacks should not coexist (40). His plans with pro-colonizationists in spring of 1863(40).

review of ourika by claire de duras
<br>
On a starkly different note, the short story Ourika by Claire de Duras details the life of a little girl who was born a slave. Based on true events, the story follows Ourika, an African child who was bought out of slavery as an infant into a white, French, aristocratic family. Ourika recalls being spoiled by her adoptive mother’s friends, who were always fondling and praising her. She is asked to perform in front of other wealthy whites’ traditional Senegalese dances as an all-encompassing representative of the continent of Africa. She was commended for her poise and grace, coded words for white-acting. To all involved, Ourika is a spectacle. She provides entertainment acts as an emotional support for Mme, whom never, along with any other family members, supports her in return. Ourika is happy until she discovers, “I reached the age of twelve without its once occurring to me that there might be other ways of being happy besides mine.” The only happiness Ourika has known is the happiness shared between wealthy whites. She never knew there was a disadvantage because of her skin color (de Duras 1998, 9). Although her adoptive mother, Mme de B., took Ourika in and gave her her ideal best life, there is an inherent disconnect. Ourika’s disappointed all started once she overhears hears Mme’s friend asking Mme what she will do with Ourika when she gets older. Mme de B. replies with a sigh, “I see the poor girl alone, always alone in the world” (de Duras 1998, 12). The friend says, “What kind of man would marry a negress?” She describes possible outcomes: having a mulatto child who could only be of low birth, only wanting a man who would never look at her, never being happy with a man (de Duras 1998, 13). Ourika describes being alone, cut off from the entire world as her concept of life has been shattered. Her distance is furthered when the son of Mme, who Ourika grew up with and was very close to, announces he is engaged: “What have I done to deserve such luck?” he says. Ourika asks herself the same, however in the opposite manner. Why had God condemned her to this life? Although she is not a slave and has been taken care of, why did she not die in the African sand? Why wouldn’t god remove her from the world? Her race had doomed her, and she was disillusioned her whole life, thinking that she was one of them. No matter how integrated and assimilated they had molded Ourika, she could never face the same fate.

   a) for document specific toolbars/menus when used
      with the LINK element in document head e.g.
        start, contents, previous, next, index, end, help
   b) to link to a separate style sheet (rel=stylesheet)
   c) to make a link to a script (rel=script)
   d) by stylesheets to control how collections of
      html nodes are rendered into printed documents
   e) to make a link to a printable version of this document
      e.g. a postscript or pdf version (rel=alternate media=print)

<!--
 The BORDER attribute sets the thickness of the frame around the
 table. The default units are screen pixels.

 The FRAME attribute specifies which parts of the frame around
 the table should be rendered. The values are not the same as
 CALS to avoid a name clash with the VALIGN attribute.

 The value "border" is included for backwards compatibility with
 <TABLE BORDER> which yields frame=border and border=implied
 For <TABLE BORDER=1> you get border=1 and frame=implied. In this
 case, it is appropriate to treat this as frame=border for backwards
 compatibility with deployed browsers.
